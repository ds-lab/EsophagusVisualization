# Data Management

Upon launching the software, you'll be greeted by the patient and visit database interface. 
This is where you can manage all relevant information related to patients with achalasia and similar conditions.

The interface is divided into three key tabs:

1. **Patients Tab**: Here, you can add, delete, or update patient records.
2. **Visits Tab**: Use this tab to log visits for a selected patient.
3. **Diagnostics & Therapy Tab**: This tab allows you to input diagnostic data and therapy details for each recorded visit.

Each of these tabs will be explained in the following sections.
